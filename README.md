# Code-Quiz

### User-Story 
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```



## How to Play
```
When the user clicks on the Start button a timer will start. You will be redirected to the questions page. When you get a question correct you will get one point. If you get a question incorrect you will lose ten seconds on the clock. Race the timer to see if you can answer all the questions correctly before time runs out!
```
## HTML/CSS/JavaScript
```
I used a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create this multiple choice quiz. 
HTML to set up the start page, questions page and submit initials page. As well as to add ID's for certain elements that I needed to target using Javascript.
CSS to style the text and buttons.
JavaScript to loop through the questions and different pages.
